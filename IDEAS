UI:
  - GitHub OAuth login to web ui
  - Lists jobs by ID, status, time, source (branch/master/PR)
  - For each job shows log output/state

Logstore:
  - on disk (on directory per day, one file per job)
  - fileformat see below (front matter + log)

Jobstore:
  - on disk as bbold DB
  - stores job metadata
  - stores annotations as index to make searching efficient

Execution:
  - use init container to run Git checkout
  - job ID is <source name>.<count(source name)>

- Also start locally instead of GH triggered. Extract owner/repo/ref from local repo
